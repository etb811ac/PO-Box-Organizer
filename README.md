# PO-Box-Organizer

## Overview
Still a WIP

We're a group of friends sharing a single PO Box in the US.  With multiple packages arriving, it can be a real headache to keep track of who ordered what, who's paid, and what needs attention first.

That's why we created this web app â€“ a simple solution designed specifically for us to streamline the chaos and make shared package management a breeze.  We can now easily see what's pending, prioritize urgent deliveries, and keep tabs on payments. No more lost packages or misunderstandings!
